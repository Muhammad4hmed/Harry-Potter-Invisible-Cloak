# Harry-Potter-Invisible-Cloak

I have added necessary comments in the code. still something confuses you? feel free to contact.
the only dependency is OpenCV.

Please note: remove the video path and change it to integer 1. to capture using webcam
line 21 will be:
```
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(1)

```

To test, make sure you have red color cloth if not then you can change the RGB colors in code to your desired color.
